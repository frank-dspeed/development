A Collection of Guides mainly driven at present from @frank-dspeed/guides and the @stealify Project

## Autonomous Software Tuning
The basic concept of PGO is to collect data about the typical execution of a program (e.g. which branches it is likely to take) and then use this data to inform optimizations such as inlining, machine-code layout, register allocation, any code and data access, etc.

There are different ways of collecting data about a program's execution. One is to run the program inside a profiler (such as perf) and another is to create an instrumented binary, that is, a binary that has data collection built into it, and run that. The latter usually provides more accurate data. It is the same concept as with Runitme Typechecking via assert calls and runtime logging.

## Software Versioning
Safes a Lot of Disk space and can provide more repeatable stable workflows that lead to higher Software Quality. It is Essential for Commercial Products.

## Software Testing
Unit, Integration, Varius, Chaos, etc. Is the key to Improve Development Speed and Confidence the same concept as with STYLE GUIDE Driven Design bei Print and Online Medien.

## 32bit 64bit history 8 bit 16bit
is a Reference to the Register Sizes Smaller Registers can be more efficent thats why it can be usefull in memory constraint environments or environments that do run many small instances.
